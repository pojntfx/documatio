## Usage

ðŸš§ This project is a work-in-progress! Better instructions will be added as soon as it is usable. ðŸš§

documatio takes all files from a `docs` directory and compiles them into the `out` directory. It also requires a `docs/metadata.txt` file with contents like the following:

```plaintext
Uni DB1 Notes
Personal notes for the DB1 course at HdM Stuttgart.

https://github.com/pojntfx/uni-db1-notes
https://github.com/pojntfx/uni-db1-notes/releases/latest/download/all.zip
ðŸ“Ž Happy persisting!
```

The first line is the title, second title the description, third one is the license header, fourth one the URL to the source, fifth a link to download everything at once and the last one is the footer.

It is also recommended to use a GitHub action to set up automatic builds at `.github/workflows/documatio.yaml` with the following contents:
